      I'm a UI/UX Designer and Front End Web Developer, with a background in
      Painting and Drawing. I am also a wedding and portrait Photographer! I
      absolutely love to create wireframes, design icons, and fiddle with CSS
      animations. While I have experience as a Full Stack Developer, what I
      really enjoy is the visual aspect of User Experience Design, as it has
      such an impact overall on what we create.
