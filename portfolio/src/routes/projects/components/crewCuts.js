Crew Cuts is a small business ran by two 
brothersin Silver Spring, MD, offering various 
services such as lawn care, moving, and 
gardening. They are in the process of building 
their website, but currently do not have 
another online presence. 


Problem

Distrust

I first began empathizing with users. I learned that
clients want to easily book a lawn care service online 
from a proven reputable local business. A common 
theme I found was a lot of clients had a distrust for 
small businesses when they did not have any reviews
or they could not see previous work, and therefore were 
more likely to seek services from larger companies.

Solution

Display Previous Work and reviews

The goal is to build a lawn-care booking app that 
users can easily see reviews, as well a previous work, 
so that they can book lawn-services at their convenience.

Research

Homeowner Survey

I took a survey of 10 homeowners in the Silver Spring, 
MD area. Specifically all of these homeowners had yards.
Five of homeowners were over the age of 50, and the 
other five homeowners were under the age of 50.

70%
Would book online vs call

80%
Look at Yelp or Google
reviews to help them 
decide on a service

100%

80%
Would rather hire a
Small local business
rather than a big company


50% hire small business or do it themselves
50% hire big well known companies

Of the 50% that hire big companies, 
100% of users said to sway them to hire 
a small business they would upon consideration
based on reviews online, or recommendations 
from someone they already know

When it comes to taking care of your yard and outdoor spaces, 
what prevents you from booking a local lawn care service versus
a big company service?

Definitely when there is no proven work to show, and no way of knowing 
how trustworthy someone is. I am busy all the time so I don’t have time
to keep watch when someone is hired to work.

Needs:
Easily see before and after photos of gardening. Reviews to show
trustworthiness and quality of work.

Frustrations:
I can’t find a lawn-service company that is timely, trustworthy, 
or has a proven track record.

As a homeowner, I want someone to plant my mums this Spring, because 
I don’t have time to garden.
