    Background
        The Product

        The Artist Bio App for an Art Gallery in Edinburgh 
        was designed to connect our target users 
        ( users who are interested in obtaining art 
        pieces such as art collectors ) with other artists via the app.

        This App was one of the projects completed from beginning to end 
        while I obtained the Certificate in UX design from Coursera.
        We utilized the five stages of the design thinking process:

        Empathize
        Define
        Ideate
        Prototype 
        Test

        Product Duration

        Problem
            

        Solution

            The goal was to create an app that allowed for users to 
            easily find art they wanted to obtain and to be able 
            to contact the artist, to spark the conversation that 
            could eventually lead to more opportunities for the 
            artist such as the user purchasing their art or their 
            art being showed in other galleries as well.




        Understanding the User - Empathize / Define
            User Research 
                Summary 
                    I found that users wanted a variety of 
                    art to select from. Users also wanted 
                    to be able to contact artists directly 
                    and from the specific gallery websites. 
                    Often galleries don’t list contact information 
                    and make users directly contact the gallery instead. 
                    Users also wanted to be able to see art and maybe 
                    not necessarily purchase it, and because of the 
                    pandemic galleries should adapt to an online audience.

                User Pain Points
                    1. Galleries don't have a way for me to contact artists
                        Provide multiple ways to contact artists, 
                        such as a contact form, the artist’s 
                        contact information, and the artist’s 
                        individual website.
                    2. Because of the pandemic, I cannot get to galleries in person.
                       Provide high quality images.
                    3. Galleries often have limited selection of art, I cannot find what I am looking for.
                        Provide multiple ways of searching for the art via the gallery app. Can put genre, artist, and multiple genres. Provide a search bar.

                
            Personas
                Tiffany Young
                Problem statement:
                    Tiffany Young is an art dealer who needs to be able to view art virtually because she doesn’t have time to travel.

            User Journey Map
                Mapping Tiffany’s journey shows several problems 
                that could arise with the app. Definitely simplicity/ 
                conciseness in the menu style and high quality photos are a must.

                Persona: Tiffany Young
                Goal: Find new art pieces for my gallery.

        Starting The Design - Ideate / Prototype / Test
        
        Paper Wireframes
            Goals for paper wireframes: The paper wireframes should have plenty of space for the images since it is an image centered app.

        Usability Studies
            I conducted two rounds of usability studies. 
            Findings from the first study helped guide the designs 
            from wireframes to mockups. The second study used a high 
            fidelity prototype and revealed what aspects of the mockups 
            needed refining.

            Round One Findings:
            1. Users want to easily find what art They are looking for.
            2. Users want to be able to view art in Great detail.

            Round Two Findings:
            1. Users want to be able to be directed somewhere after filling out contact form.
            2. Users want to get a confirmation email.

        Refining the Design: 

        High-Fidelity Prototype
