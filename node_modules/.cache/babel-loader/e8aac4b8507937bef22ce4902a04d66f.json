They are in the process of building their website, but currently do not have another online presence. Problem Distrust I first began empathizing with users. I learned that clients want to easily book a lawn care service online from a proven reputable local business. A common theme I found was a lot of clients had a distrust for small businesses when they did not have any reviews or they could not see previous work, and therefore were more likely to seek services from larger companies.
