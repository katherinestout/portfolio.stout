We utilized the five stages of the design thinking process: Empathize Define Ideate Prototype Test Product Duration October 2021 - December 2021 Problem Solution The goal was to create an app that allowed for users to easily find art they wanted to obtain and to be able to contact the artist, to spark the conversation that could eventually lead to more opportunities for the artist such as the user purchasing their art or their art being showed in other galleries as well. Understanding the User - Empathize / Define User Research Summary I found that users wanted a variety of art to select from. Users also wanted to be able to contact artists directly and from the specific gallery websites. Often galleries don\\u2019t list contact information and make users directly contact the gallery instead. Users also wanted to be able to see art and maybe not necessarily purchase it, and because of the pandemic galleries should adapt to an online audience. User Pain Points 1. Galleries don't have a way for me to contact artists Provide multiple ways to contact artists, such as a contact form, the artist\\u2019s contact information, and the artist\\u2019s individual website. 2. Because of the pandemic, I cannot get to galleries in person. Provide high quality images. 3. Galleries often have limited selection of art, I cannot find what I am looking for. Provide multiple ways of searching for the art via the gallery app. Can put genre, artist, and multiple genres. Provide a search bar. Personas Tiffany Young Problem statement: Tiffany Young is an art dealer who needs to be able to view art virtually because she doesn\\u2019t have time to travel. IMAGE OF PERSONA / with stuff on it User Journey Map Mapping Tiffany\\u2019s journey shows several problems that could arise with the app. Definitely simplicity/ conciseness in the menu style and high quality photos are a must. Persona: Tiffany Young Goal: Find new art pieces for my gallery. IMAGE OF USER JOURNEY MAP Starting The Design - Ideate / Prototype / Test Paper Wireframes Goals for paper wireframes: The paper wireframes should have plenty of space for the images since it is an image centered app. Digital Wireframes SEE SLIDESHOW IMAGE INSERT GRAPHIC WITH LABELS Low-Fidelity Prototypes Link to low fi prototypes https://www.figma.com/proto/BkvbbGLoYEyj2PUKLNQsWp/EdinburghGalleryApp?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=8%3A415 Usability Studies I conducted two rounds of usability studies. Findings from the first study helped guide the designs from wireframes to mockups. The second study used a high fidelity prototype and revealed what aspects of the mockups needed refining. Round One Findings: 1. Users want to easily find what art They are looking for. 2. Users want to be able to view art in Great detail. Round Two Findings: 1. Users want to be able to be directed somewhere after filling out contact form. 2. Users want to get a confirmation email.
